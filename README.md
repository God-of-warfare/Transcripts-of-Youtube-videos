## Preprocessing and Chunking Audio for Analysis

This document describes the approach used to preprocess and chunk audio files for further analysis. The focus is on creating meaningful chunks based on semantic similarity and duration.

### Workflow

1. **Audio Preprocessing:**
    - Sample rate is set to 16 kHz.
    - Noise is reduced using the `noisereduce` library.

2. **Transcription:**
    - Whisper-large-V3 turbo model transcribes the audio and provides word-level timestamps.

3. **Punctuation:**
    - The `deepmultilingualpunctuation` library is used to punctuate the transcribed text. This library leverages a fine-tuned Bert model for effective punctuation.

4. **Chunking:**
    - The transcript is split into chunks based on sentences identified by full stops and question marks.
    - Word-level timestamps are used to define the start and end times of each chunk. A 0.5-second buffer is added at the beginning and end to avoid audio cuts.
    - Chunks longer than 15 seconds are split further at commas.
    - Chunks with less than 4 words are merged with neighboring chunks to ensure a minimum word count and adhere to the 15-second duration limit.
    - Sentence-Transformers library utilizes the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to generate embeddings for each chunk. Neighboring chunks with high cosine similarity (> 0.2) are merged if the combined duration stays below 15 seconds.

5. **Output:**
    - Processed chunks with timestamps are printed for further analysis.

### Advantages

- Sentence-based chunking promotes semantic coherence within each segment.
- Word-level timestamps guarantee accurate chunk boundaries (assuming accurate transcription).
- Punctuation and potential minor transcription errors are addressed using a fine-tuned Bert model and sentence transformer embeddings.
- The chunking process is efficient and suitable for most audio containing well-defined sentences.

### Limitations

- Performance may suffer with content lacking structured sentences, such as math lectures.


**Note:** This approach is implemented in Python and utilizes libraries like `noisereduce`, `deepmultilingualpunctuation`, and `sentence-transformers`.
